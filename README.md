# JDATA potential customer prediction
### This project utilized data from JDATA algorithm competition to make analysis on customer-oriented data. 
### Our goal: Developed algorithm models on history sales record to predict a certain user’s purchasing activity.
# main steps:
### 1.Conducted data cleaning and feature engineering to describe consumer behavior.
### 2.Produced statistical analysis of data characteristics.
### 3.Conducted feature extraction. (user features and product features)
### 4.Utilized the stratified sampling methods to train, evaluate and modify the ‘forecast model’.
